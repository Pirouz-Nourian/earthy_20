**Floor plans - Kangaroo**

From the area program, we derived the strong and weak connections between spaces and used the syntactic tool to derive a bubble diagram showing the adjacencies. Simultaneously, the site was analysed to establish nodes on the site and connect them. A manually drawn concept floor plan allowed us to determine how the building spaces would flow from these nodes. A hierarchy of spaces was formed from public to semi-public to more private spaces as a zoning plan. The shops and public square were decided to remain static for floor plan optimization.

Based on the brick dimension of 0.3 x 0.15 m, a grid of 1.2 m is used to determine the area of rooms. The kangaroo solver is given this information, along with preferred orientations, adjacencies, and connections. A linework for basic site boundary and roads is added to direct the solver to give possible layouts.

The kangaroo solver gave different options that helped to come up with a floorplan from a rectilinear grid to a more offsetted one. The final layout which closely resembled our visions was post-processed to make the final floor plan.
