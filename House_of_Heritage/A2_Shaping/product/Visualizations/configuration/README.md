**Floor plans - Architectural description**

The floor plan has a flow of spaces from the public square to the main courtyard and to the secondary courtyard. The public square is the major communal junction and access point with shops and walkways around it. The three majestic gateways serve as the main entrances to this court. The main courtyard is semi-public, acting as a spillover space for the multipurpose hall and exhibition spaces, whereas the secondary courtyard is more private serving as a working space for prototyping and other workshops. The building mass on the top floor is intentionally located on the south side for mutual shading. It also sits on top of smaller rooms on the ground floor with a denser grid for structural reasons.
