## Group 04 | Heritage Center
<br>

### **Statement**

**Refugees** coming to the Zaatari camp have been displaced from their home country and their **identity** is at stake. By providing them certain **facilities** their **cultural identity** could be **preserved**. A **Heritage center** could help to retain their **identity** where one could engage and stay rooted to their **culture and history**.

### **Design Problems**

- **Lack of traditional Syrian craftsmanship:** The war has caused a loss of artisans especially in the specialized arts and crafts of Syria. These arts can get lost over time therefore there is a need to preserve them.
- **Negligence of vernacular architecture:** Due to the modernization of building materials traditional materials and techniques have been overlooked. Although it takes more time, skill and maintenance, these methods have proved to be more sustainable  and perform better in harsh climates.
- **Lack of communal spaces for cultural celebration:** The existing camp falls short of space for cultural events and communal gatherings.
- **Economic poverty:** Due to lack of skills, the majority of refugees do not have work permits leading to  economic poverty. Development of a skill set would foster job opportunities and reduce economic poverty over time.
