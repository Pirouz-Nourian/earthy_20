## Workshop construction
Step 1

Catenary curve is traced on used cardboards which are taped on one of the walls. The catenary curve is easy to determine since the height of the roof (2.4 m) and the width of the room (6.6 m) is known.


Step 2

The cardboard is laid on the floor and grid boxes out of used cardboard are made. These grid cardboard boxes take the shape of the catenary arch and are glued together.


Step 3

The cardboard arch is closed off from the top and the bottom so that the forces can transfer more uniformaly.


Step 4

The cardboard arch is hoisted in its position on stilts made of temporary earth bricks. Waste timber frames are used to make a temporary truss to support the cardboard arch.
