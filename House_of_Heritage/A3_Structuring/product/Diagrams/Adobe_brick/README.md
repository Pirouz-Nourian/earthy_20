## Adobe brick
The bricks to be used would be made of adobe and made by refugees in the camp. Therefore, the process needs to be simple to understand and the sizes have to be easy to handle while constructing.

Brick composition

The adobe bricks would be made of materials that are locally available in and around the site. The standard brick composition is 30% clay, 30% fine sand, 40% coarse sand and 10% water of the total weight of the dry ingredients. According to study, adding straw increases the strength of the bricks considerably. Therefore 10% of straw is added to the total mixture. The mixture is made using bare hands and feet after which they are placed in wooden moulds made up of scrap wood collected in the camp. The mixture is hand pressed in the moulds and allowed to dry for 28 days depending on the local weather conditions (W.Jinwuth & S.Hengrasmee, 2017). During the time of construction, the mortar is made in the same composition with a higher percentage of water to make it sticky.

Brick types

Type - A:
This brick type would be the most commonly used in walls, arches, vaults and roofs. According to study the brick module should follow the 1:2:4 size ratio, so that the edges can match if the brick rotates perpendicularly. Therefore the dimension of this brick is 29x14x6.5 cm with a spacing of 1 cm for the mortar if two headers were to join to match the stretcher side. In order to keep less no. of brick types, the size of this brick could cater to arches and roofs as well.

Type - B:
This type has a dimension of 29x6.5x6.5 cm and is primarily used as the queen closer for corner junctions. An English bond of brick composition is proposed for the ease of understanding for the people.

Type - C:
This special type of brick is used for construction of the Muqarna domes which would translate the Syrian vernacular architecture.
