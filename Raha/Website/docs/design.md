## 0_Introduction 
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This site documents the design process of RAHA, a recreational center designed within the borders of the Zaatari camp. RAHA is an Arabic word meaning comfort, rest or relaxation; it is also an acronym for recreational activity hub actuator. The intention behind the design of the building is to create a recreational facility where the refugees in the camp can interact with one another while participating in culturally relevant activities. The recreational hub contains programmatic functions that allow for the refugees to relieve their stress and engage in informal counseling and therapeutic activities. While the social objectives are to re-introduce a sense of normalcy for the camp residents; the design of the building explores the use of computation for creating 21st century earth buildings. 

The design process is explained in 4 stages: Configuring, shaping, structuring and Constructability. The configuration stage starts with identifying a problem that can be addressed by a missing building on a selected site followed by defining the programs and their co-responding relationship. In the shaping phase, the form-finding of the building is studied where different roof tessellations are explored. This is followed by the structuring phase where the building form is structurally analyzed using karamba. In line with the structuring phase, the ease of construction was studied where different construction methods and sequences are tested. Based on the design progression, the final output is presented with the chosen construction method and defined bricks and modules.

### About Zaatari
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The Zaatari camp is the largest camp for Syrian refugees set up in Jordan following the breakout of the Syrian civil war in 2011. The camp started operating in 2012 admitting 15,000 refugees by August 2012. The number of refugees in the camp increased over the years to a staggering 78,357 by October 2018. During this time, the camp evolved from a small collection of tents into a permanent urban settlement. 

The camp is divided into 12 districts, there are 32 schools and 52 community centers. Presently the UNHCR coordinates the infrastructure improvements and shelter assistance within the camp along with the provision of energy supply. There are pre-fabricated shelters including latrine and kitchen. 
</div>

### Problem statement
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The Zaatari camp houses a large number of Syrian refugees. Although the camp was set-up as a short-term accommodation the ongoing war has prolonged the duration to latent permanency. As a result, long-term solutions are required not only in accommodation but also by providing adequate and culturally relevant community-based facilities that also work towards informally addressing underlying issues related to the holistic well-being of the refugees.

Refugees residing in the camp come from a war-ridden place, they have had traumatic experiences most of which have lost loved ones and left loved ones behind. Research shows various distresses reported among refugees including avoidance, anger, helplessness, fear and reduced functioning. The various types of distress result in the deterioration of the refugee’s mental well-being and hinder their chance of having a stable normal life. As the number of residents within the camp continues to increase and extend their temporary stay; the facilities in the camp are rendered incapable to cater to the needs of the incremental population. Therefore, it is essential to have centers geared towards relieving their distress and creating a better living environment within the camp.

### Intervention
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
For the refugees to be re-integrated into a sense of normalcy, a vast array of facilities must be incorporated within the camp.

The proposed intervention is to introduce a “recreation hub” including a tea house, a hammam, a play area for children and connecting courtyards with herbal gardens. The proposed function is a culturally relevant community based “recreation hub” where the spaces allow for various levels of human interaction, activities and informal counseling. These spaces will be correlated based on a multilayer programmatic requirement considering the area, climatic needs, visual connections and zoning of the public-private spaces.
</div>

### Design vision
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The design vision is to create a “recreation hub” hosting social spaces with partly interchangeable functions, which have comfortable indoor climates by learning from vernacular architecture and utilizing appropriate building technology that allows for efficient use of space, limited resources and ease of constructability.

### Overall flow chart
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This flowchart shows the overall procedural workflow adopted for designing RAHA. The whole project is divided into four stages, Configuration, Forming, Structuring and Constructability respectively. The larger division of stages offers an eventual progression of the design by keeping each stage incoherence and informed with the other to achieve a generative design.
</div>

[![overall flow chart](img/ofc.jpg)](img\final overall flowchart .jpg)  
*Fig: Overall flow chart of the design process (click image to zoom in).*

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The first part is configuring followed by shaping and structuring. In the configuration phase: based on the identified problem and proposed intervention; the main programmatic functions were defined. A set of rules were developed to select the site after which the program relationships were developed using bubble diagrams and REL charts. These were computationally mirrored using a phyton script and a syntactic tool. Further relationships were studied using metro-link diagrams and depth graphs. Based on the outcome, the study was translated to a concept plan which was further developed computationally using gradient descent optimization. Following these studies the floor plans were formulated. 

In the shaping process, the required architectural principles for each space was ranked based on set priority criteria to inform the form-finding process. Based on this, different dynamically relaxed roof tessellations were studied after which roof and wall modules were defined. 
Based on the defined modules, the structuring phase starts with the simplification of the tessellated roofs. The simplified roof surfaces are meshed and structurally analyzed on karamba. Here the material properties and cross-sections are defined. Based on the results of the structural analysis the roof tessellations and wall thicknesses are optimized for best results. 

The constructability was studied along with the structuring phase. Different construction systems are analyzed and ranked based on ease of construction and adaptability to the different modules. The materials available on-site are studied for the potential to aid the construction system. The chosen system is further developed computationally and further studied with a physical model. The brick sizes and modules are defined. The construction system and sequence are developed along with the required formwork. 
</div>

## 1_Configuration

In the configuration phase of the design process, based on the design goals the programs will be defined along with their spatial requirements and the area requirements. Based on the site study, the relationship between the programs and the integration of the programs into the site will be studied using various computational and graphical methods. 

### Site selection 
![Location flow chart.jpg](img/location.jpg)  
*Fig: Shows the site selection flow chart*
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
As per the proposed intervention of building a recreation hub, the main programmatic functions are a tea house, a hammam, a quiet space with a library, and a play area for children with connecting courtyards housing herbal gardens and water bodies.  To select the site the points of consideration are unbuilt spaces, water resources, proximity to other facilities such as schools and kindergartens and the distance from the main road. As the recreation hub includes a hammam, locating it near a water resource is essential. The recreation hub also includes a quiet space with library, a children’s playground which can be an extension to existing schools, youth centers and kindergartens. 
</div>

![Location Selection.GIF](img/location.gif)

[Click here to download the script](rev/scripts/Location_finder.gh)

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
To select the site, a computation tool was created that first identifies built/ unbuilt space and road networks. The tools select the empty plots on the site. These plots are further filtered by size taking only in-between spaces of larger sizes.  Then the existing water resources are mapped. Open spaces that fall within 250 m of the existing water resource are selected. The existing schools, youth centers and kindergartens were mapped and the site selection was further narrowed down to open spaces within 100m of the mapped centers. From the remaining list, the hierarchical demarcation was given to the open spaces based on the distance from the main busy road with preference given to quieter spaces further away from the loud busy main street. At this stage, spaces in districts 6, 7 and 9 were identified. The final chosen site falls in district 9 which has the least saturated population therefore the proposed facility can cater to a larger percentage of the district’s population.
</div>

The chosen site in District 9 was then studied based on factors to understand the nearby context, climate, access routes, nodes etc. The total site area was 3880 (81m x 48m) sq.m. 

The site is oriented along the North-South axis and the predominant wind direction is from the West. The main access road is from the East. There is a Mosque and a bore well on the West while the North and South is flanked by kindergarten and residences.

### Program of requirements

![Program of requirements](rev/configuration/Program_of_requirements.png)
*Fig: The program of requirements of the project*
[Click here to download](rev/configuration/Program_of_requirements.pdf)

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Having selected a site to fit the Raha building a program was developed.  
with the functions that are to be hosted in the building came also some demands on capacity, size, level of privacy, and desire for daylight. Below these choices will be explained.
</div>

<ins>Tea house</ins>  
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The tea house is one of the main functions of Raha. Its purpose is to connect people and provide them with a place where they can meet and socialize.
To do so there will be two seating spaces, a public one and a private one to allow for more intimate conversations. Together they will have a capacity for 150 people. They will be located ad the southeastern part of the building to have propper daylight which helps create the ambiance required. 

There will also be a tea bar and kitchen located in this area to provide visitors with food and drinks. These functions will have to be close to a separate entrance for them to be provided with supplies. Daylight is a necessity in the kitchen but it would help to reduce the need for artificial light.

To make sure that visitors with kids are also welcomed there will be an indoor and outdoor play area for the children.

All of these functions will be connected with a courtyard, named the herbal garden this courtyard can provide herbs for the tea that is being served in the tea house. Visitors are welcome to help with the gardening of this garden.  
There will also be some toilets connected to the herbal garden.
</div>

<ins>Hammam</ins>  
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The hammam is a more secluded part of the Raha building, it is there to provide comfort hygiene for male and female the layout of the hammam will be the same and as follows.  
From the Waterbody courtyard, you enter the main hall and entrance of the hammam.
Where you can get your towels and go through to the changing room to continue either to the steam room, or the public or private bath spaces.  
All of these rooms require good ventilation and daylight but are private so this should be taken into account when designing said room.  
The hammam as a whole can host up to 125 people.
</div>

<ins>Quiet area</ins>  
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Also located next to the waterbody courtyard is the quiet area. The quiet area hosts the next functions.
The quiet rooms where people can come, sit, read, and enjoy a quiet space.
A library and several workspaces are provided for the visitors which can provide help he visitors de-stress from the day to day routine. All of these rooms require daylight, hence, north orientation was chosen for these rooms.  
</div>

<ins>Entrance</ins>  
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
In order to enter the site, an entry check point was porposed highlighting the name of the project While entering, the visitors will first walk into the water fountain courtyard. From which they can choose to go to the waterbody courtyard or the herbal garden courtyard.
</div>

<ins>Service zone</ins>  
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
To provide all the functions from there required services like heating, water, power, storeroom, etc. There will be a service zone that has his separate entrance and is connected to the hammam, tea house, and water fountain courtyard.
</div>

### Connectivity of spaces
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
After deciding which functions should be in the project to achieve our vision the relations between these functions were studied. To do so we went through the next steps multiple times untill the the project relations were coherent.  
</div>

**Rel chart**  

![REL-CHART](rev\configuration\relchart.PNG)  
*Fig: The final REL Chart.*
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The REL chart shows the relationship a certain function or room has with every other function or room. In the beginning, assumptions were made on which function should be connected to which other function. By analyzing the results this chart was changed to make sure it provided a better input for our syntactic tool.
</div>

**Bubble diagram**  
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Taking the REL chart created in the previous chapter the connections were analyzed using a bubble diagram.  
Starting with the syntactic tool for Rhino Grasshopper.
To make the process of checking and rechecking more automated rather than building a new bubble diagram each time. A script was created to generate points and their connections based on the connections in the REL chart.
</div>

![dots and lines for bubble diagram](rev\configuration\bubble_diagram\bubble_lines.png)  
*Fig: Dots and lines generated by the output of the REL chart, this will be input for the syntactic tool*

![script for making all this](rev\configuration\bubble_diagram\bubble_script.png)  
*Fig: The script is used for generating the lines between the dots, based on the value implied in the REL chart*

![bubble diagram using syntactic tool](rev\configuration\bubble_diagram\Syntactic.jpg)  
*Fig: Bubble diagram made using the syntactic tool in grasshopper*
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This bubble diagram was studied and connections were moderated if necessary. However, it did not provide us with the clear bubble diagram that we were expecting from the program. So we converted it into a manual bubble diagram. This also gave us the option of giving a certain weight to the connections as is shown below.
</div>

![bubble diagram manual](rev\configuration\bubble_diagram\bubble_manual.png)  
*Fig: The final bubble diagram*

**Hierarchy of spaces**  
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
After creating the bubble diagrams we analyzed them. To do some more effectively we looked at the hierarchy of the spaces as this gives a good view of how private the rooms are and how long it would take a visitor to reach them.
</div>

<ins>*Depth chart*</ins>

[![depth chart](rev\configuration\bubble_diagram\depthchart.jpg)](rev\configuration\Depth_chart_big.jpg)  
*Fig: Depth chart of the functions*
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The depth chart as shown above clearly shows the hierarchy of the spaces. For instance, it shows a clear split between the hammam areas and the tea bar areas. It also shows how deep the bathing spaces are in the building. Which is where they are designed to be. This heirarchy branches from public spaces to private spaces, which helps in determining the connectivity between spaces.
</div>

<ins>*Metro link diagram*</ins>  

![depth chart](rev\configuration\bubble_diagram\metro_link.jpg)  
*Fig: Metro link diagram*  
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
To show the connections on a conceptual level, a metro link diagram was created as shown in the figure. This link helped in understanding the adjacencies and provided a mind map for the users to connect between the spaces and which route to opt for.
</div>

![depth chart](rev\configuration\bubble_diagram\depthchart2.jpg)  
*Fig: Connectivity chart*  
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Deconstructing the depth chart, the connections were transformed into a spatial configuration showing the transition between the different depths in the chart. 
This shows a conceptual arrangement of the spaces which serves as a base for the computational configuration process.
</div>

### Summary 

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The configuration process identified the stages in the design porcess which were supported by an algorithmic logic.By defining the problems and the design goals, a list of functional spaces were proposed which were formulated by a set of rules. These spaces were further analyzed to derive a logical relationship between different functions with the help of bubble diagram and depth chart. These connections developed a schematic spatial layout which was explored further in the forming phase.
</div>

---  

## 2_Forming

In the forming phase of the design: Based on the relationship study and depth graphs, the programs are arranged in a defined grid. Here the space grammar is transformed from 2D to 3D where the relationship between the spaces is configured three-dimensionally. Different roof tessellations are studied along with the connectivity between adjacent spaces.

### Spacial configuration

**2D Study**  
 
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Once a conceptual analysis of spatial clusters and their connections was identified, a computational approach of gradient descent was adopted to configure these spaces in 2-dimension.    

This approach was inspired by the previous year's work, wherein one group had developed a gradient descent tool. In this project the tool was further was adapted and revised to the desired goals.   

First a grid of 1.2 m x 1.2 m was considered, derived from a standard corridor width size and minimum area for one person. Therefore, each functional area was adjusted to a multiple of this grid size.

An excel table was created to input the hierarchy of spaces (from the depth chart in an ascending order) and their area dimensions (from the program of requirements). As seen in image below, the excel is used to import these inputs into the Grasshopper environment.
</div>

[The excel can be downloaded here.](rev\scripts\Space_layout_excel.xlsx)  

![ExcelInputGD](img/ExcelInputGD.PNG)  
*Fig: Spatial parameters translated as inputs into an excel sheet for the gradient descent tool*

The flowchart explains the pseudo code used to develop this tool.   

[![GDFlowchart](img/GDFlowchart.jpg)](img/GDFlowchart.jpg)  

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

In the script, all input from excel is sorted together to branch into a data structure informed by depth hierarchy and creates rectangular spaces as per space dimensions. The site dimensions are used to generate a grid of 1.2m x 1.2m to snap spaces to this grid further. The north direction input informs the creation of rectangular regions in directions of North, South, East, West, North-east and South-east at a given distance from the centre of the site. It populates these regions with the assigned spaces. 

The entrance checkpoint curve input is the starting point to relax depth 1 in this case water fountain courtyard dynamically. For this, it is important to set goals. As dynamic relaxation in principle mimics the working of spring, the most important goal was to set a constant tension line between the entrance checkpoint and the water fountain courtyard. It is then that the two spaces are dynamically relaxed that attracts the depth 1 spaces (water fountain courtyard) to the attractor space (entrance checkpoint).

This process is then repeated, keeping the relaxed curves from hierarchy depth one as the attractor for the depth two and the relaxed curves from depth two become the attractor for the depth three spaces so on. This process of staged relaxation per depth hierarchy enhances the configuration results, by aligning spaces orthogonally and reduces chaos when the total number of spaces is high.    

</div>

![GDSpaceF](img/GDSpaceF.gif)  
*Fig: The animation shows the spatial configuration result of this computational process*  

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
From the many iterations this tool generated, the most ideal solution was chosen considering the site boundary conditions. 
</div>

For further study the script can be download on the [Other page.](other.md)

**3D Study**  

![connectivity of spaces](img/connectivity-of-spaces.gif)  
*Fig: 3D Visualisation of connectivity of spaces*

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
It was neccessary to analyse the 2D configuration in a 3D space to determine the adjacencies and connectivity in the horizontal and the vertical plane. The outputs generated from the computational tool were used as an input for this study.

First step was to study the ratio between the built v/s unbuilt spaces and define the proportions of the unbuilt spaces depending on the widths of the adjacent built spaces.
Next step was to connect the built and the unbuilt spaces and understand the nature of the connection. This was determined by analyzing if the connection was an exterior, interior, horizontal or vertical connection. Once the connections are defined, the walls were extruded. Certain spaces like the quiet rooms, workspaces and the sheesha were placed on the first floor as the nature of the space determined it's position. As the quiet rooms and the workspaces required a quiet and calm environment and the sheesha required an open to sky configuration, the spaces were placed on the first floor.   
</div>

### Configured design

**Modular grid**    
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
After having configured the general layout, it was important to translate it into the final plan for the building. For this, a grid of 1200mm x 1200mm was selected. The logic was based on the fact that 1200mm is the minimum corridor width required for a person. The grid was further refined into a Tartan grid. This consists of straight lines of varying widths and distances, crossing at right angles. Tartan grids allow for modularity in the size of built elements. Elements are restricted to centre on the centreline grid and limited in dimension to stay within the tartan bands.   

The optimized grid has 600mm bands with 2400mm distance between each 600mm bands. This is to ensure that all walls lie in these bands and no module in the building is less than 2400mm x 2400mm. The reason for choosing the width of tartan band as 600mm comes from a small study done on commonly used wall thicknesses for various spans. This was also backed by the previous year structural reports. So when two modules are placed adjacent to each other the wall thickness between them is the combination of the wall thickness of each module but is constructed as one and load from both roofs is directed to the centre of this combined wall. Our assumption was later proved to be correct and details of that can be found in 3_Structuring.
</div>

![Modular Grid](img\Tartan-grid.gif) 
*Fig: Shows the optimization of grid*

**Floor plans**  
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Once the grid was fixed, different spaces were then moulded in the plan based on the area fixed in the programme requirements. This also resulted in different modules of roofs and walls based on how many tartan bands they occupy. The second step was to fix the dimensions for the courtyard. To do this, the traditional Iranian geometric design method was adopted. It uses a golden rectangular design, which is drawn inside a regular hexagon. The ratio of length to width being 1.73. The width of the Water-fountain courtyard is double the width of the rooms adjoining it. This is done so that rooms receive proper daylight. The Water-body courtyard and Herbal garden are cosier and requires mutual shading therefore, these are equal in widths with the adjacent rooms.
</div>

![Courtyard proportion](img\Figure9.png) 
*Fig: Shows the traditional Iranian geometric design for courtyards*

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Below you can see how different spaces comes together to form the final plan. As informed from the computational and manual processes, the courtyards form the main connecting elements each equipped with a transition vestibule space. The tea-bar with it’s different seating spaces are placed in the east of the site. The hammam in the south west corner closer to the mosque and bore well and the library and quiet room spaces in the north west to make use of daylight. 
</div>

As shown here, there is a main entrance which can be reached by a pedestrian route to keep it away from the busy main street. On the back of the site, there is a service road provided which functions as a supply route for several functions and is a way in for the employees and maintenance.  The unloading & loading service zone is near the kitchen and store for the ease of use while the other services are divided in two service rooms placed near the Hammam. 
</div>

![Site Plan](img\1_Siteplan.jpg)  
*Fig: Shows the Site plan*

**Architectural Characteristics**
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
As one of the aim was to develop a feeling of comfort and familiarity among the inhabitants of the camp therefore, we studied the vernacular and traditional architecture of Syria. Some important characteristics that were common are the courtyard planning, different types of domes, vaults and archways used and the transition between spaces. These characteristics were then incorporated into the design by carefully analysing each module based on the following factors and assigning priority to these factors based on the type of space that they serve.

Geometry: If a space had a square or rectangular layout
Daylight: If the space needed to be dimly-lit, completely-lit or partially-lit.
Pre-defined architectural characteristics: If the space already had an architectural style from the vernacular, for e.g.: Hammam had domes with skylight.

The following table shows the spaces onto which the roofs will be placed and the order of their most important criteria.
</div>

![Architectural Characteristics](img\architecturalcharacteristics.png)   
*Table: Shows the Architectural characteristics*

**Roof modules** 
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The architectural characteristics and tartan grid divides the building into 8 different roof modules which are shown below.

**Wall modules**  
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The tartan grid is not just limited to plan but also extends in the vertical direction to the walls. The wall openings: window and doors have been positioned based on the tartan grid as you can see below.

**Details**
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Following topics gives details about the heating, ventilation and rainwater services in our building. Once the different modules with different roof structures are placed adjacent to each other, it is important to make sure that these are well connected to avoid percolation of water in the ridges. Another important aspect was to provide heating and ventilation in the hammam to keep it comfortable.
</div>

<ins>*Rainwater Services*</ins> 
<div style="text-align: justify">
To fill in the gaps between the two roof and to ensure that water doesn’t percolate in, the gaps were filled with sand. A desired slope is achieved for the water to run off the building. A coating of Lime plaster is applied on the outer surface for the Hammam domes and tadelakt for the other roofs to ensure sealed surface.

<div style="text-align: justify">
To heat the Hammam, we have a boiler in the service room which is connected to the public and private baths and steam rooms through the floor. This will make sure that the Hammam area is evenly heated all throughout the year. To ventilate, the Public bath has a skylight on top and there are seams provided on the top and bottom of the doors of steam room and private bath for ease of construction and ventilation.

### Summary 
<div style="text-align: justify">
The Forming process strategically developed a shape from the spatial configuration based on the REL-Chart and the bubble diagram. In order to define the shape and the layout, a grid was defined which became the base for converting the design ideas and concepts into the proposed site boundary. This grid was imminent in making the design more modular.
</div>

---

## 3_Structuring 

In the structuring phase of the design process, the building form is analyzed for structural integrity. Here the material properties are defined and the different modules are tested using karamba. Iterations were made to the cross-section dimensions and to the roof tessellations based on the result to ensure the structure is compression only load bearing form.

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The form-finding was determined by the study of architectural characteristics of different spaces. To start the process and understand how different meshes gave different shapes, a thorough literature study was conducted. During this process, we considered a roof form and it's the corresponding size, and manually meshed the initial divisions. The initial divisions followed a logic that was derived from the literature research. Different types of meshing logic were explored initially and were imported in the kangaroo solver to generate the dynamically relaxed form. Different meshing logic gave a different result, for example, the quad split logic generated a curved peak while the triangulation logic generated a pointed peak. This step was repeated for every type of meshing logic and the triangulation meshing logic was chosen as it closely resembled the desired form. Later these meshes were imported in the kangaroo solver to subdivide the initial meshes and generate the dynamically relaxed form.

To test the tesselations that were made a grasshopper script was made.
For this script, the inputs are the tesselation lines and the anchor lines. The anchor lines can be set to a different strength to create openings in them for the cross vaults.

During the process of relaxing and checking the roofs, it sometimes occurred that the top of the roof was lower than the points around it. To fix this some tweaking with the edge lengths had to be done.

**Final Tesselation**

![Tessellation initial](img/Initialroof.jpg)  
*Fig: Showing the initial roof tessellations*
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
As the triangulation meshing logic was chosen initially, after dynamically relaxing the meshes, we realized that the form generated failed to perform well structurally. The dynamically relaxed roof did not transfer the loads uniformly and developed peak tensile stresses at the edges of the walls. Moreover, the meshing logic did not work well for larger spans as it generated fairly flat surface at the top of the dome which gave rise to peak tensile stresses at the highest points of the roof.
</div>

![FinalTesselation](img/FinalTesselation.jpg)

![InnerTesselation](img/InnerTesselation.jpg)   
*Fig: Showing the final roof tessellations seperated by the wall thickness*  
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The final tesselation logic was a combination of constant quad split and triangulation method. This logic was structurally analyzed and worked well structurally as the load distribution was uniform and peak tensile stresses generated were considerable. Moreover, this logic closely resembled the desired form and maintained the form irrespective of the span.

![wallTessellation](img/walltessellation.jpg)  
*Fig: Wall tessellations* 

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Though a computational method was used for the roofs, for the walls we opted for a manual approach. The meshes for the walls were generated using the initial divisions of the roof mesh. The intersecting points between the roof and the wall determined the mesh lines for the walls. These mesh lines became the guideline for the division of the arched opening in the wall. A similar mesh logic was applied in the wall meshing as done for the roof meshes; constant quad split and triangulation method. Once the walls with the openings meshed, walls without openings followed the mesh lines of the latter. After the initial meshing of the walls, they were imported to weaverbird in grasshopper to subdivide the initial meshes and make the meshes more coarse and match them with the roof meshes.

### Simplification 

**Square domes**

![Square](img/square.gif)  
*Fig: Evolution of the dynamically relaxed form*
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
In order to achieve a smooth form and for the ease of construction, the dynamically relaxed form was refined further. The initial tessellation, based on the tartan grid, was approximated and simplified to the closest curve resembling the generated mesh. These curves were used to build the final surface of the roof which was later analyzed in karamba 3D for structural calculations. 
</div>

![Square simplification](img/3x3domesimplification.jpg)  
*Fig: Simplification logic of Square domes*
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The dynamically relaxed form was refined under a specific geometry to ensure accuracy in construction. Each curve of the form was re-drawn to the closest ellipse. These ellipses were made using the edge points of the meshes and then cut into half to derive the elliptical curves. For the square domes, two types of ellipses were used: one ellipse in the vertical and horizontal direction and one for the diagonals. The final surface was generated using these elliptical curves and imported to weaverbird in grasshopper for further refinement.
</div>

![Square simplification](img/9x9domesimplification.png)  
*Fig: Simplification logic of Square domes*
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This logic was repeated for the other square domes: 6 x 6 M and 9 x 9 M. The curves were scaled twice for the 6 x 6 m dome and thrice for the 9 x 9 m dome. In case of 9 x 9 m dome, additional curves were drawn to match the initial tesselations and for structural stability.
</div>

**Rectangular domes**

![Rectangle](img/rectangle.gif)

Similar logic was applied for the rectangular domes.

![rectangular simplification](img/6x3domesimplification.jpg)  
*Fig: Simplification logic of rectangular domes*
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
In case of rectangular domes, two different ellipses were made. One ellipse was made in the center dividing the top ridge into 2 parts and the second ellipse was drawn from the corners of the rectangle, creating a slight curvature on the smaller sides of the ceiling.
</div>

**Cross vaults**

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The dynamically relaxed form was refined under a specific geometry to ensure accuracy in construction. Each curve of the form was re-drawn to the closest catenary arc. These arcs were made using the edge points of the meshes and then cut into half to derive the catenary curves. For the cross vaults, only one catenary arc was used to generate the surface. The final surface was generated using these elliptical curves and imported to weaverbird in grasshopper for further refinement.

### Material selection 
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Due to the change in the course structure due to Covid-19, material research and testing was not part of the brief. We referred to the tests and analysis done by the previous year students of the same course. We primarily considered the test results of Bustan group (Group 5) and chose the same materials and material limit states for our project.  
</div>

![material](img/materials.jpg)  
*Fig: Material composition*
<div style="text-align: justify">
The adobe bricks should be made by the refugees at the campsite with the available materials. The recipe for the standard brick composition was 30% clay, 30% fine sand, 40% coarse sand and 10% water of the total weight of the dry ingredients. Additionally, straw was chosen as an addition to the adobe paste to improve the tensile strength of the brick. The straw was added in the percentage of 10% of the total mixture. The final mixture was then placed in the required molds and allowed to dry to make the bricks. The mortar was also prepared with the same basic composition with a higher percentage of water as required to make the sticky paste. (Bustan,2019)
</div>

![gypsum mechanical properties](img/Gypsum.jpg)  
*Fig: Mechanical properties of Gypsum*
<div style="text-align: justify">
Since elliptical curves were used to simplify the geometry, the combination of interlocking bricks and adobe projected in the elliptical curve leads to an increase in the number of brick modules. In order to reduce the number of modules and ease of constructibility, gypsum bricks were used instead of adobe bricks for the ribs. A literature study was conducted to understand the mechanical properties of gypsum. From the study, it was concluded that gypsum stabilizer indicated higher compressive strength values compared to adobe. (Türkmen, Ekinci, Kantarcı & Sarıcı, 2020)
</div>

![limit states](img/Limitstates.jpg)  
*Fig: Design Values*
<div style="text-align: justify">
The limit states of the material were obtained from a research paper (Clifton, J. R., & Davis, F. L., 1979.) and Last year's material report written by Bustan group (group 5). From the literature study (Clifton, J. R., & Davis, F. L., 1979) we concluded that safety factor within the range 1.2-2 is ideal in this case. In case of addtional floors above, safety factor of 4 was considered.

### Structural analysis

*Fig: Structural analysis process flow chart*

**Process**

![initial approach](img/processsofstructuralanalysis1.jpg)  
*Fig: Initial approach for structural analysis of the structure*
<div style="text-align: justify">
Structural analysis of the generated geometry was implemented in Karamba 3D in grasshopper. The structural analysis process was carried out in 2 stages. In the first stage, the chosen dynamically relaxed form was placed over the vertical base after which the wall and the roof meshes were merged to form a uniform mesh. This uniform mesh became the input for the karamba analysis. 

It was observed that the load distribution was not uniform as we observed peak tensile stresses at the edges of the wall and irregularity in the load distribution in the roof. This was due to irregular surfaces and meshes generated from dynamic relaxation. Moreover, the ridge between the wall and the roof was visible distinctly; therefore, the wall and the roof meshes were not coherent.
</div>

![final approach](img/processsofstructuralanalysis2.jpg)  
*Fig: Final approach for structural analysis of the structure*

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
In the second stage, the simplified surface of the wall and the roof was chosen for further analysis. In this case, the wall and the roof were analyzed separately. First the roof was analyzed using the simplified geometry. The reaction forces from the roof were given as an input to the wall analysis along with the self-weight of the wall. The wall was then analyzed.

It was observed that the load distribution was uniform and the meshes were coherent. The peak stresses developed at the edges and the corners of the wall were within the set limits and the transition between tension and compression was logical and regular. High compression at the bottom of the wall and at the top of the roof and tension at the corners and the edges of the wall determined the analysis was performed correctly. Moreover, the analysis proved that the roof can be made into a complete compression roof which fulfilled the ultimate goal.

The structural analysis does not consider gypsum as the material for the ribs. Adobe material properties were considered for the entire structure. As gypsum has higher compressive strength as compared to adobe, it was assumed that using gypsum would give better results in the analysis.

In order to verify the results of the karamba analysis, a test module was considered which was generated manually.

In this case, it was observed that the maximum compression was at the highest points where the wall and the roof intersected whereas the maximum tension was observed at the corners. This verifies that the load distribution is correct and the karamba model gives accurate results.

### Summary 
<div style="text-align: justify">
After structurally analyzing the geometry, it can be concluded that in most cases, the originally assumed wall thickness (max 600 mm according to the tartan grid) was accurate. For certain modules, the wall thicknesses were more than 300 mm due to the presence of first floor or double height space. The roofs were optimized to behave in complete compression, except the corners, which showed low tensile stresses. In order to achieve structurally sound geometry, it was important to refine the meshes and redo the tessellations as the type of mesh determined the distribution of the loads. Further, the mesh was simplified to the closest ellipse and was imported to karamba. This process was repeated several times until the final form was achieved. 
</div>

---
## 4_Constructability
<div style="text-align: justify">
This phase in the design process was carried alongside the structuring phase. To understand how the construction of the defined modules can be achieved with unskilled laborers, various literature reviews were referred to. The referenced construction methods were explored further by simple digital and physical model making. Thereafter, the rib-infill construction method was chosen as it can be easily adapted to the different modules present. Step by step of the constructability processes will be explained below. 
</div>

### Methodology   

**Relationship between different modules**
<div style="text-align: justify">
To define a construction method, first, the relationship between the different wall and roof modules was studied. Since the floor plan was configured based on a tartan grid, the modules are multiples of each other. 

As seen previously in the simplification process, the tessellated roofs of the different Dome modules were approximated using elliptical curves. The Dome roof modules are approximated with multiples of the radius of 2 ellipses, the diagonal ellipse with a radius of (2.12 m, 1.2m) and the horizontal ellipses of (1.5m, 1.2m). multiplying the radius of these ellipses with 1, 2, 3 will give us 3x3, 6x6, 9x9 domes respectively. 

The vaulted domes are made up of 2 square domes. For instance, the 3x6 dome is made up of two 3x3 square domes placed adjacent to each other. Therefore, the elliptical curves of the 3x3 dome can be used to approximate the 3x6 vaulted dome. Which in turn means that multiplying the radius of the base ellipses (diagonal ellipse with a radius of (2.12 m, 1.2m) and the horizontal ellipses of (1.5m, 1.2m)) with 1, 2, 3 will give us the 3x6, 6x9, 9x12 vaulted domes respectively.  This means that all the domes except for the Adobe 2.0 are scaled and replicated versions of the smallest size (3x3). 
</div>

![scalability](img/scale.gif)  
*Fig: Relationship between different modules* 

**Construction method**
<div style="text-align: justify">
Because of the way the roofs are tessellated and because of the scalable relationship between the different types of roofs, a rib-infill system of construction was chosen. This limits the amount of required formwork and makes the construction process easier. 
</div>

<ins>*Rib system approach*</ins>  

The next step was to figure out how to make the ribs in a way that can easily be constructed with unskilled laborers and requiring limited formwork. Here various types of construction systems were looked at. From literature review, a few examples of interlocking construction systems were taken into consideration to determine the applicability for the construction of the roof modules. 

### Interlocking bricks

<ins>*design process*</ins>
<div style="text-align: justify">
The approach for the interlocking blocks was: if the blocks were placed in order of their interlocking nature, they would automatically generate the curvature of the rib. This means there is no need for centering, a guide or a large formwork. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">
This idea was digitally modeled first for a simple semi-circular arch. The first model shows an interlocking brick system with just one brick module. 
</div>

![Interlocking brick one](img/interlocking1.jpg)  
*Fig: Interlocking block 1* 

<div style="text-align: justify">
The second model is a modified version of the first model where the interlocking blocks are shaped in a way, they can easily be molded to form adobe blocks. Here the corner base stones are of different module and there is a key-stone in the middle. This module was tested by 3d printing the 4 different modules.
</div>

![Interlocking brick two](img/interlocking2.jpg)  
*Fig: Interlocking block 2* 

![3dPrint1](img/3dPrint1.jpeg)  
*Fig: 3-D Printed prototype of interlocking block 2* 
<ins>*system exploration*</ins> 
<div style="text-align: justify">  
For the interlocking rib system, one can either have the ribs made from gypsum or adobe. The advantage of using gypsum over adobe is that large pieces can be made with gypsum and it thus reduces the number of different modules required for construction. In both cases, the material cannot withstand tension forces in the interlocking joints. Therefore, for the ease of construction of these ribs, various interlocking patterns were studied and compared on the basis of their simplicity with the mould, material usage and sharp edges to finalize one. The table below shows the analysis in detail. 
</div>

![Comparateive](img\Interlockingtable.jpg)  
*Table: Comparative Analysis of Interlocking Patterns* 

*Computational tool development*  
<div style="text-align: justify">
To make the desired ribs fit all the domes that are in the project a computational tool has been designed.
The script takes in curves that it turns into ribs. these curves can be made by projecting lines to the roof surface.
</div>

After this it does the flowing:
1. Splits the curves into segments provided by the stone sizes.
2. Offset those curves and turn them into a cross-section using a provided indentation size.
3. Extrude the offsets creating a stone.
4. Mirror them around to generate all the ribs.
5. Get the roof surface between the ribs.
6. orient bricks to this surface using the pattern specified in the script.

For further study the script can be download on the [Other page.](other.md)

![rib maker](rev\constructability\Rib-gif.gif)  
*Fig: Showing the process followed by the rib maker gif*

*Experiment*  
<div style="text-align: justify">
To better understand the process and sequence of construction of the different types of modules of the building, an experiment was carried out and a scaled model of Module 2 i.e. 6000mm x 6000mm dome was made. The bricks for the interlocking rib system were 3D printed and the infill bricks were hand molded from play clay and were baked in an oven for 10 minutes.     

To construct this model, the first step was to mark the square base on a sheet of paper. As a next step, the curve of the rib segment was drawn and cut out from a piece of cardboard to be used as formwork to lay the interlocking bricks. This formwork was placed on the square base and each brick was then placed in position with the help of tack glue. Once all the ribs were in place the keystone was put and the infill layer from the baked bricks was put. 
</div>

![3DPrint2](img\3DPrint2.jpeg)      
*Fig: Shows the bricks in one rib forming the required curvature when simply placed next to one another following the interlock sequence*  

![Experiment1](img\Experiment1.jpg)         
*Fig: Shows the different processes of the experiment*  

<div style="text-align: justify">
With this experiment, it was concluded that the interlocking bricks dictate the curve of the ribs and the formwork was only required to hold them in place. Once the ribs and keystone are in place, the infill bricks can be laid out in concentric circles to ensure that compressions bands in the dome are always complete before laying the next course. 
</div>

<ins>*Construction instrument*</ins>
<div style="text-align: justify">  
The context of the site generates several limitations like the availability of limited resources and skilled labours on the building process. Therefore, it was important to find a process that made use of minimal supporting materials, tools and skills. This created an opportunity for innovative solutions to solve the problem of constructability. Therefore, we designed a tool called The Support Spider that can aid the labours and make the process simple and efficient. This tool is made entirely from the materials available on site.    
</div>  
  
![Tool](img\Instrument.jpg)  
*Fig: Shows the Support Spider*

*General concept and design of the tool* 
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The tool works on the logic of creating an ellipse which can be viewed below. Notice that at 3 min 16 sec, one can see that the top segment is created by taking the radius as the end of the minor axis and the point on the minor axis where the line segment cuts it. For the simplification of the tool, this radius is found out for all the ellipsoidal segments of the domes and the supporting rods are then made. Since the tool is required only as a support and not the guide for curvature, it is possible to generalize it and make the supporting rods flexible in length. Below you can see the process. Notice the red denotes the extention in the tool.  
</div>

![Support Spider](img\Intrument.gif)  
*Fig: Shows the process followed in developing the Support Spider*

*Adaptation to different modules*
<div style="text-align: justify">
As mentioned earlier, all domes are the scaled versions of the smaller dome, so all the elliptical arches of these modules which form the interlocking ribs are scaled versions or the smallest arch. Therefore, they all have a common center. The tool is designed to fit the smallest module and can be expanded to the largest module by increasing the length of the supporting rod.  
</div>  

![Extension](img\Extension.jpg)  
*Fig: Shows how the tool can be extended to fit all curves*

### Adobe 2.0

**Design concept** 
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The idea behind introducing Adobe 2.0 in the course was to push the limits to explore something which has never been built before in adobe. For this challenge, the inspiration came from the Lamella tessellations found in sunflowers. These tessellations occur in the Fibonacci sequence in nature and shifts horizontally keeping the same centre creating a twisting pattern. On further research an origami lamella dome was found as seen in figure below, which helped us in better understanding the shape of the dome. The attractive feature of this geometry was the opening it creates at the apex, serving as a deciding factor on selecting it. Having an opening at the apex created the skylight we envisioned for the hammam main hall and public bathing spaces, i.e. the three 9mx9m dome modules.        
</div>

![Lamellaorigami](img/Lamellaorigami-.jpg)    
*Fig: An origami model of the Lamella dome, source:[Flicker](https://www.flickr.com/photos/yoshinobu_miyamoto/4400658370/)* 

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
On research it was found that the curves in the Lamella tessellation follow a fibonacci interpolation of points. Therefore,this informed the starting point of generating a computational script for this roof module.
    
</div>

**Computational tool**
 <div style="text-align: justify"> 
A computational script was made to inform the Adobe 2.0 geometry and inform the bricklaying accordingly.

The inputs for this script are the diameter of the dome, the number of segments, squinch height and brick height in order to create this Fibonacci based dome, that twists and offsets to form a conical dome leaving a skylight at the top.   

An integrated pyhton script counts the number of the bricks per segment of the Lamella dome's leaf and colours them as per assigned code, as seen in the animation below. This is an essential information for the brick laying process. 

A discrete corner stone design is achived such that this stone can be repeated on all the corner conditions of the dome retaining the aesthetic quality of the geometry. 

However, for the squinch, this script creates different block sizes that form the unique ribs, but the form offers repitation of these ribs, reducing the complexity in construction.

</div>

*Fig: Shows the computational tool generation in steps for creating Adobe 2.0*

<ins>*Construction instrument*</ins> 
<div style="text-align: justify">  
In the construction of the dome of Adobe 2.0, there were two challenges; one was that not only the bricks offsets in plan but also rotate with a certain angle to generate the golden spiral and the other was to make the squinching from the square base to convert it into a circular base for the start of the dome. To solve the first challenge, a Fathy’s compass was used. This tool has a pipe anchored to a pole fixed into the ground in the centre of the circular space to be covered. With its help, the labour can lay bricks in proper circle and complete the dome. To inform the worker about the angle of rotation another simple tool called the angle measure was made. It was observed that all bricks rotate at the same angle from the previous brick of the previous course. Therefore, with the help of Fathy’s compass and angle measure, it’s possible to create the Adobe 2.0 dome easily and efficiently. 

For the second challenge of squinching from square base to circular base, the idea was to create interlocking ribs to inform the curve and infill the bricks to finish the squinching. Due to the time constraint, this method was not explored to its full potential. 
</div>

### Materials

**Brick Library**  
<div style="text-align: justify">  
To give a clear overview of the bricks and which brick is used where a brick library was made. This document shows which bricks are needed to construct the dome ribs. The infill between these ribs is less critical when it comes to the brick size other than it should have a thickness of at least 200mm.
the brick library contains the bricks for the following modules:
</div>

1. Domes
    - 3x3  meters
    - 6x6  meters
    - 9x9  meters
2. Vaults
    - 6x3  meters
    - 9x6  meters
    - 12x9 meters
3. Cross vaultes
    - 3x3 meters

**Materials Used for Construction**  

![Material table](img\Material_Table.jpg)  
<ins>*Construction sequence*</ins>  

The construction sequence of the different modules is illustrated below. 

*Square Domes (3x3, 6x6, 9X9)*  

As mentioned earlier the construction system chosen is the rib-infill method where the ribs will be made of interlocking blocks. 

To construct these domes, first the layout of the walls will be marked based on the tartan grid from the center using a rope. Once the out line has been defined, the site will be excavated and the foundation of the building will be laid with stones. After the foundation is in place the floor is compacted and rammed back. Then the bricks of the walls are laid in a pattern leaving the gap for the door and window openings. To construct the arches of the windows and doors, a compass is used to guide the mason. Once the arches are in place, the rest of the wall is completed. 

![dome](img\d.gif)  
*Fig: Shows the construction sequence for square domes*

After the completion of the wall, the construction of the roof begins. First the corner base bricks are placed at each corner of the diagonals, then the base bricks are placed at the center of each side of the wall. Once all the base bricks are in place, the middle bricks are put on top of the base bricks in the manner of their interlocking nature. The spider support instrument is used to support the bricks while they are being put together vertically. At the meeting point of the 8 arches, the keystone is inserted stabilizing the rib structure. Once the rib structure is in place, the infill is constructed. Then the roof is covered with a water- resistant layer.

*Rectangular Vaulted Domes (3x6, 6x9, 9X12)*  

The Construction of the vaulted domes is quite similar to that of the domes. The vaulted domes are made of split dome ribs placed at either sides along the long side of the rectangular wall outline and a middle arch. 

![Vaulted dome](img\vd.gif)  
*Fig: Shows the construction sequence for rectangular vaulted domes*

After the walls have been constructed, the base corner bricks are placed at each corner. Then the base bricks are placed at the center of each sides of the wall. As the diagonals have different curvature than the middle curves, the base stones are of two modules. The middle interlocking bricks are placed one on top of the other following their interlocking nature. Three spider supports are used; one on each side and one for the middle elliptical arch. At the meeting point of the 3 arches at each side and the two arches in the middle, the keystones are put in place stabilizing the rib structure. Following this, the infill is constructed and a water protective layer is placed to cover the roof. 

*Cross vaults (3x3)*  

The construction of the cross vaults is similar to the domes. Here the cross-vaults are of one square module. To construct the cross vaults four base stones of the same kind are placed on each wall corner. Then the middle bricks are placed in order of their interlocking nature. At a point where the 4 arches meet, the key stone is placed stabilizing the rib-structure. Then the infill is constructed followed by the water protective layer.  

![Cross Vault](img\cv.gif)  
*Fig: Shows the construction sequence for cross-vault*

*Adobe 2.0*  
The construction of the adobe 2.0 is broken down into 3 parts. The first part is the dome squinch, to construct the dome squinch starting from a square base to a segmented circular base on which the twisting dome structure begins. The bricks are laid concentrically where the corner stones are of a different shape, the developed computational script generated a sequence of brick numbers that need to be laid consecutively on a line before the direction of the brick laying changes. After placing the line of bricks in the same angle the corner brick is placed, which informs the direction change of laying the bricks. In such a way the bricks are laid with the help of a compass that is used to align the brick to the proper angle. 

![Adobe 2.0](img\ad2.gif)      
*Fig: Shows the construction sequence for the Adobe 2.0*

After the squinch is constructed the twisting dome is constructed in 2 stages, the bottom half and the top half. This differentiation is needed because the top section uses smaller brick sizes. 
Based on the sequence of bricks that can be laid before the angle changes which is informed by the computational script. The line of bricks is put in place followed by the corner stone of a different size and shape that informs the directional change. Then the next line of bricks is placed concentrically until the full loop is complete, then the next layer of bricks is placed based on the brick sequence number. The compass is used to align the bricks to the required angle in each segment and course of the brick laying. In this manner the first section of the twisting dome is complete. The height where this section ends is also informed by the computational script. 

![Adobe 2.0 construct](img\adc1.PNG)  
*Fig: Shows the construction technique for the Adobe 2.0*

The final section of the brick in laid in the same way using a smaller module of bricks which can be seen in the brick catalog. The bricks are placed concentrically leaving a skylight opening at the pinnacle of the twisting dome.

### Summary 

The building modules are based on the tartan grid, they are scalable variations of each other. This along with the chosen type of tessellation makes the choice of rib-infill construction ideal. The construction of the ribs with interlocking blocks contributes to the ease of construction using very limited formwork. The simplification of the roofs using elliptical curves increases the number of interlocking brick modules as the curvature of the ellipse changes. By having larger interlocking brick segments casted out of gypsum, the ribs can be created with a few large modules that is lightweight. These can also be easily assembled using the spider supports when needed.

## 5_Conclusion
<div style="text-align: justify">
The ongoing war has prolonged the short-term accommodation towards latent permanency, providing adequate and culturally relevant community-based facilities became important to ensure the holistic well-being of the refugees. The project RAHA was aimed at providing comfort and a sense of belongingness to the inhabitants of the Zaatari camp. 
</div>
</br>

<div style="text-align: justify">
An optimal district was selected by setting the limitations of adjacency to a water source, free plot size and nearby facilities. 
Along with the set parameters, the urban analysis of the other projects was taken into consideration, which affected the site selection process. Once the site was selected, it was important to establish the program requirements and understand the connections between various spaces in the building. For this, a thorough study was conducted by drawing different bubble diagrams, REL charts, depth chart and metro-link networks which served as an input for the gradient descent solver, thereby generating our final layout. To make the design more modular, a Tartan grid was chosen which became the base for the further development of roofs and walls.
</div>


<div style="text-align: justify">
The modular geometry was then simplified for the structural analysis. The roofs were optimized to behave in complete compression, except the corners, which showed low tensile stresses. The walls were optimized to take the load of the roof above and also to not exceed the width of the Tartan bands. To make the construction more realistic, a higher safety factor was considered to cover the inefficiency in the construction process. 
</div>


<div style="text-align: justify">
The construction process and materials were carefully researched to finalize the appropriate method for the buildability. These methods take into consideration the limited resources on-site, skills of the labourers and time required during the construction. The instruments, along with the different brick modules for interlocking, make the process easy and efficient.
</div>

Limitations: 

- General: The computational process is limited to the software used.    
- Site selection tool: The limitation of this script is that the criteria are subjective. It can be further developed to make it adaptable to different building functions. 
- Gradient Descent tool: While the script strives to create a Tetris inspired configuration, there is further scope of developing an efficient grid-snapping system that avoids collisions and overlap of spaces after the dynamic relaxation. 
- Material Study: Due to the change in the course structure dictated by the transfer for of education online, it was not an option to test materials which limited the material properties considered in this project. This led to selecting them from the last year's works.   
- Structural Analysis using Karamba: The Karamba model does not consider the forces in the horizontal direction, as the mesh is analyzed as a shell instead of a plate. The wind loads were not included in the analysis as it was negligible. 
- Interlocking blocks: The concept of interlocking bricks work very well for circular curves as they generate the same module of bricks, however, when they are adapted to elliptical curves, every brick module in the curve becomes unique increasing the number of modules. 
- Construction Instrument: The instrument developed is still at a conceptual stage, while the logic for the tool works; the assembly of the tool is not covered in the scope. 
- Adobe 2.0 dome computational tool: Due to the time constraints, the tool was not developed to create interlocking bricks for the ribs in the squinch area of the dome.

The design studio of Earthy is an enriching way to end the formal learning of the 3 semesters in the master porgram of Building Technology. It focuses on all aspects of an Architectural design project made with Adobe, while focusing on the technical aspects using mathematics and computational logic, which I enjoyed thoroughly. I have realised this approch generates a coherent design that best answers the design problem. The course has helped upskill my computational skills in Grasshopper a plugin for Rhinocerous and laid a good foundational understanding of python in the grasshopper interface. Having said that, my motivation to further my skills in this field has only grown with this experience. The design of RAHA resulting from this course in 10 weeks duration, is absolutely a proud achievement for me. To make this happen the team worked tirelessly and always inspired me to push boundaries. I would like to thank my very hardworking group of teammates for their constant virtual support in today's digital world. I would also like to share deep appreciation towards the instructors of this course who kept us motivated and guided us throughout the course.

It allowed me to explore various approaches, design and construction methods of compression only structures within the limits of the earth material. The python workshops were very useful. Yet, because of the rapid pace of the course we didn’t boldly experiment with python scripting within our design as we would have liked. All in all, the 10 weeks flew by and it was an enjoyable learning experience and one of the best team collaboration projects yet.

The course AR3B011 Earthy is an amalgamation of diverse topics ranging from spatial planning, programming, construction techniques and structural design. The entire learning process was indeed remarkable and a different approach towards thinking mathematically and computationally. One major challenge of the course was to design with limited material resources and unskilled labor. Although adobe construction is something that has been done for ages, it is not commonly adopted construction material that developed the perfect design brief in the proposed location. Moreover, the structuring phase was an additional challenge due to the lack of assistance for the structural analysis using Karamba 3D and Ansys.

Nonetheless, we are happy with the results we have achieved for such a fast-paced course. I personally learned a lot from this course and the experience of working with my enthusiastic team members was incredible as we all gave our 100% to this project.

The Earthy course had it all. From more familiar subjects like planning of functions and buildings to matters that I only encountered since the start of the master like visual scripting using Grasshopper. And then there was the brand new, constructing earth buildings and using a coding language like Python.
I look back at the course as being an intense learning environment, in the 10 weeks we had to make our submission I believe we give everything and came up with a great design.
Given the minimal knowledge I had about scripting and grasshopper I believe this course has given me a lot of experience with it in a short time.
If I could do the course over with the knowledge I now possess I would focus more on coding our scripts in python rather than Grasshopper. However, the basic understanding of grasshopper was not as well developed as it now is so it would have been almost impossible.
That is why I would like to learn about using Python in the time to come.

The Earthy course is a design studio which has the steepest learning curve as compared to all the other courses in the master's track of Building Technology. I personally enjoyed this course as I have worked with earth before but never encountered the possiblity of combining a primitve material with the current technology using the latest computational softwares. The best part about this course was the constructibility phase as I throughly enjoyed myself exloring different construction techniques in order to close the loop. The course was structured in a way that pushed me to think more and with every challenge we faced, especially with adobe 2.0 structure, it only increased the level of complexity and intensity of the course, which made the course extremely interesting. Within the 10 weeks of the coursework, the first few weeks were intense due to the different workshops and lectures. I personally think that these workshops/lectures could have been split into two parts as many of them were more relevant for the 2nd half of the coursework. 
All in all, I am extrememly proud of what we have achieved as a team to complete the project sucessfully. I would like to thank my fellow group mates for working tirelessly to make RAHA happen. I would also like to thank all the tutors who helped us throughout the course.
