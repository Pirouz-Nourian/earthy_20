After having analysed the site conditions and determined the connections between the functions in this part of the project we started forming floor plans and building shapes.

## Flowchart
Throughout the whole process the flowchart shown below will be our guide to keep insight in the process.

## Final bubble diagram
Below the last bubble diagram is shown, this has been the guideline for creating the floorplan.

From this bubble diagram the hierarchy of spaces can be analysed as shown below there are different levels of depth to the building.
The deeper you go into the building the more privite the rooms become, a natural example of this is the hammam which is located at the deepest depth in the building.

## floorplan
To interpertate the bubble diagram into a floorplan we used a gradient decent tool to make different options for the layout.
a gif of this process is shown below.

After this study the results are transformed into a grid based layout as shown below.

Futher interperting these lay outs we went into more detail, also adding walls.
To do so we converted the grid from a traditional one to a tartan grid which also incorporates the thickness of the walls.

This will be our starting point going into the next fase, this however does not mean it is a final floorplan.
It will be further optimized in the structuring process

This is the ground floor plan

This is the first floor plan

During the making of the floorplan the connectivity of the spaces was also studied, the GIF above shows the 3D view of these analyses.


## tesselations
Before going into the structuring phase of the project several different tesselations where studied to increase our understanding of the process.
Below a amount of the explored tesselations are shown, sub-devided into domes and vaults.

This tesselations will help us to structure the building this is what we are going to explore the coming weeks
