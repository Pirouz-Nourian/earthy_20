# CONFIGURING:
## 1. CONFIGURATION APPROACH:
The process of Architecture designs many times is compared with Art. It can be argued that logic and reasoning is not a necessity for generation of art. But when it comes to Architectural design of a project which is meant for human habitation it should rely on logic and reasoning since the result has consequences on the comfort and wellbeing of the occupants. Adapting to such an approach will also lead to a process for which each step can be traced back, analyzed and modified for a better result .This was the main idea that led us to create the approach for configuration of Terratetris.

## 2. MAIN GOALS:

To breakdown the human process of Architectural design as accurately as possible into procedural functions.

To consider the opinions of the camp dwellers as much as possible in the configuration of the camp as a whole and also at an individual house dweller.

To think of the housing problem at a system level rather than at a acse level for a wholistic and integrated output

To generate a system that is flexible for accepting conflicting decisions and can potentially generate a lot of options for the participants to evaluate
